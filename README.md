# Dog-Classifier-Project

### Project Overview 

In this task, I constructed and prepared a neural system model with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) move getting the hang of, utilizing 8351 canine pictures of 133 varieties. CNN is a kind of profound neural systems, which is regularly used to break down picture information. Ordinarily, a CNN design comprises of convolutional layers, enactment work, pooling layers, completely associated layers and standardization layers. Move learning is a procedure that permits a model produced for an assignment to be reused as the beginning stage for another errand. The prepared model can be utilized by a web or versatile application to process genuine world, client provided pictures. Given a picture of a canine, the calculation will foresee the type of the pooch. On the off chance that a picture of a human is provided, the code will distinguish the most taking after pooch breed.

### Summary of the project: 

We will utilize profound learning calculation called Convolution neural system to group hound breeds. We will utilize open cv2 to identify people and mutts from the pictures. At that point we will assemble our own CNN design. The outcomes from this CNN model isn't persuading as it gives extremely awful exactness. So we will utilize move learning idea. That is, we will utilize pre-prepared model. For our situation, we will utilize ResNet50 model. The exactness which we arrive is around 80 percent. So as to test our application, we will likewise utilize an example of six pictures to test certifiable situation. 

### Interesting and difficult things in the project:

It was astounding to perceive how CNN calculation functions so well in pictures. There are 133 classifications and CNN does so well in anticipating those classes. The most troublesome part is building my own CNN calculation. Neural system has such a significant number of parameters that it is hard to tune them. In any case, on account of udacity's example model, which helped me to fabricate my model with more noteworthy than one percent exactness. 

### Steps:

Stage 0: Import Datasets 

Stage 1: Detect Humans 

Stage 2: Detect Dogs 

Stage 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) 

Stage 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (utilizing Transfer Learning) 

Stage 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (utilizing Transfer Learning) 

Stage 6: Write your Algorithm 

Stage 7: Test Your Algorithm


### Results

1. The model was able to reach an accuracy of 83% on test data.
2. If a dog image is supplied, the model gives a prediction of the dog breed.
3. The model is also able to identify the most resembling dog breed of a person.
