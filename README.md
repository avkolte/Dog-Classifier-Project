# Dog-Classifier-Project

Project Overview 

The goal of this undertaking is, if a pooch is recognized in the picture, it will give a gauge of the canine's variety. In the event that a human is recognized, it will give a gauge of the pooch breed that is most looking like. We will utilize Convolution Neural Network (CNN) since it works very well for pictures. 

Summary of the project: 

We will utilize profound learning calculation called Convolution neural system to group hound breeds. We will utilize open cv2 to identify people and mutts from the pictures. At that point we will assemble our own CNN design. The outcomes from this CNN model isn't persuading as it gives extremely awful exactness. So we will utilize move learning idea. That is, we will utilize pre-prepared model. For our situation, we will utilize ResNet50 model. The exactness which we arrive is around 80 percent. So as to test our application, we will likewise utilize an example of six pictures to test certifiable situation. 

Interesting and difficult things in the project:

It was astounding to perceive how CNN calculation functions so well in pictures. There are 133 classifications and CNN does so well in anticipating those classes. The most troublesome part is building my own CNN calculation. Neural system has such a significant number of parameters that it is hard to tune them. In any case, on account of udacity's example model, which helped me to fabricate my model with more noteworthy than one percent exactness. 

Steps:

Stage 0: Import Datasets 

Stage 1: Detect Humans 

Stage 2: Detect Dogs 

Stage 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) 

Stage 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (utilizing Transfer Learning) 

Stage 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (utilizing Transfer Learning) 

Stage 6: Write your Algorithm 

Stage 7: Test Your Algorithm
